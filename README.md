## Context
- The keycode "us" includes the ISRT layout that I use.

- The reason why I include the tars for dwm and st is incase something goes wrong and you/me need a clean slate.

### Credits

- [Distrotube](https://www.youtube.com/c/DistroTube/) for his build of dwmblocks.
- [Luke Smith](https://lukesmith.xyz/) for his scripts.
