## Context
- The keycode "us" includes the ISRT layout that I use.

- The reason why I include the tars for dwm and st is incase something goes wrong and you/me need a clean slate.

- I include a folder that has all the patches applied, incase you are curious what was used or you want to repatch to fix something.

### Credits

- [Distrotube](https://www.youtube.com/c/DistroTube/) for his build of dwmblocks.
