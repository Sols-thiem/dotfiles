These are my dotfiles as the title of the repo implies, a bit of context to clear somethings.

The keycode "us" includes the ISRT layout that I use.

The reason why I include the tars for dwm and st is incase something goes wrong and you/me need a clean slate.

CREDITS:

Distrotube for his build of dwmblocks and Luke Smith for his scripts, I removed and edited some to fit my needs.
